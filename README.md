- **Inconsistency Resolution**: Standardized categorical fields (e.g., state, zone)
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted relevant fields to numerical types
- **Outlier Handling**: Managed outliers using techniques like winsorization
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new or derived features for better analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA investigates:
- **Gender**: Customer distribution by gender and purchasing trends
- **Age**: Age distribution and influence on spending patterns
- **State**: Regional variations in sales
- **Marital Status**: Relationship between marital status and purchasing behavior
- **Occupation**: Differences in purchasing behavior across occupations
